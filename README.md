# Investigating Discrepancies between ChebNet and GCN
This is the code implementation of the Geometric Deep Learning mini project.
we focus on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Chebyshev Spectral Graph Convolutional Networks (ChebNets), which are two of the advancements that extend the convolutional operations to graph structured data. By examining on different datasets, we aim to show their similarities and differences for a deeper understanding of the two models.
